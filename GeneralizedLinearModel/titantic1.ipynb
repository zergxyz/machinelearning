Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set. Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.\n\nIn this mission we're going to learn how to compete in Kaggle competitions. In this introductory mission we'll learn how to:\n\n* Approach a Kaggle competition\n* Explore the competition data and learn about the competition topic\n* Prepare data for machine learning\n* Train a model\n* Measure the accuracy of your model\n* Prepare and make your first Kaggle submission.\n\nKaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. The most popular of these competitions, and the one we'll be looking at, is about predicting which passengers survived the **sinking of the Titanic**.\n\nEach Kaggle competition has two key data files that you will work with - a training set and a testing set."

We call this step acquiring domain knowledge, and it's one of the most important determinants for success in machine learning.\n\nIn this case, understanding the Titanic disaster and specifically what variables might affect the outcome of survival is important. Anyone who has watched the movie Titanic would remember that women and children were given preference to lifeboats (as they were in real life). You would also remember the vast class disparity of the passengers.\n\nThis indicates that Age, Sex, and PClass may be good predictors of survival. We'll start by exploring Sex and Pclass by visualizing the data.\n\nBecause the Survived column contains 0 if the passenger did not survive and 1 if they did, we can segment our data by sex and calculate the mean of this column.

We can use the ```pandas.cut()``` function to help us out.\n\nThe ```pandas.cut()``` function has two required parameters - the column we wish to cut, and a list of numbers which define the boundaries of our cuts. We are also going to use the optional parameter labels, which takes a list of labels for the resultant bins. This will make it easier for us to understand our results.\n\nBefore we modify this column, we have to be aware of two things.

The first model we will use is called Logistic Regression, which is often the first model you will train when performing classification.\n\nWe will be using the scikit-learn library as it has many tools that make performing machine learning easier. The scikit-learn workflow consists of four main steps:\n\n* Instantiate (or create) the specific machine learning model you want to use\n* Fit the model to the training data\n* Use the model to make predictions\n* Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions\n* Each model in scikit-learn is implemented as a separate class and the first step is to identify the class we want to create an instance of. In our case, we want to use the LogisticRegression class.\n\nWe'll start by looking at the first two steps. First, we need to import the class:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n```\n\nNext, we create a LogisticRegression object:\n\n```python\nlr = LogisticRegression()\n```\n\nLastly, we use the ```LogisticRegression.fit()``` method to train our model. The ```.fit()``` method accepts two arguments: X and y. X must be a two dimensional array (like a dataframe) of the features that we wish to train our model on, and y must be a one-dimensional array (like a series) of our target, or the column we wish to predict.\n\n```python\ncolumns = ['Pclass_2', 'Pclass_3', 'Sex_male']\nlr.fit(train[columns], train['Survived'])\n```\n\nThe code above fits (or trains) our LogisticRegression model using three columns: Pclass_2, Pclass_3, and Sex_male.\n\nLet's train our model using all of the columns we created above."

Our next step is to find out how accurate our model is, and to do that, we'll have to make some predictions.\n\nIf you recall from earlier, we do have a test dataframe that we could use to make predictions. We could make predictions on that data set, but because it doesn't have the Survived column we would have to submit it to Kaggle to find out our accuracy. This would quickly become a pain if we had to submit to find out the accuracy every time we optimized our model.\n\nWe could also fit and predict on our train dataframe, however if we do this there is a high likelihood that our model will overfit, which means it will perform well because we're testing on the same data we've trained on, but then perform much worse on new, unseen data.\n\nInstead we can split our train dataframe into two:\n\n* One part to train our model on (often 80% of the observations)\n* One part to make predictions with and test our model (often 20% of the observations)\n\nThe convention in machine learning is to call these two parts train and test. This can become confusing, since we already have our test dataframe that we will eventually use to make predictions to submit to Kaggle. To avoid confusion, from here on, we're going to call this Kaggle 'test' data holdout data, which is the technical name given to this type of data used for final predictions.\n\nThe scikit-learn library has a handy [```model_selection.train_test_split()```](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function that we can use to split our data. train_test_split() accepts two parameters, ```X``` and ```y```, which contain all the data we want to train and test on, and returns four objects: ```train_X, train_y, test_X, test_y```:"
